# toDoApp
One of my very first projects that helped me understand the main concept of JavaScript.
All added tasks are being saved to the local storage of the browser so they will show up even if you close the html file. 
I didn't work on CSS that much because my main focus was understanding the JS code. 
However, I will make some changes to it once I get some free time.

There are a few problems that I didn't bother myself to fix.

Known issues:
1. Users can add an empty task.
2. The remove all tasks button works but the animation is showing twice.
